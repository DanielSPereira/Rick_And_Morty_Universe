![Project image](./public/pj.png?raw=true)

## This is a simple POC about what would be an implementation with the following technologies:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Graphql](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Redux/Redux-Thunk](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## Getting Started

First, install the packages and run the development server:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
# or
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Running tests

This project is using the following libraries to running tests:
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/)

To editing or implementing new tests you can start by adding or modifying the files in the `./src/__tests__/` folder and then running the command:

```bash
# vitest starts in watch mode by default.
yarn test
```
